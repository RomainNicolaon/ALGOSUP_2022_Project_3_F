# Technical specification

  The end goal of the project is to have a synthetiser that let users program a music (note, scale, amplitude, length, effects,...).

  The users will be able to do it thanks to an interface in which they will be able to program their music.
  
  This project was inspired by multiple softwares and API like Sonic Pi and its purpose is for us to improve ourselves in project making, programming in F# and working in groups.
