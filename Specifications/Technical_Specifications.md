# 1. Purpose of the project

  The end goal of the project is to have a synthetiser that let users program a music (note, scale, amplitude, length, effects,...).

  The users will be able to do it thanks to an interface in which they will be able to program their music.
  
  This project was inspired by multiple softwares and API like Sonic Pi and its purpose is for us to improve ourselves in project making, programming in F# and working in groups.
  
# 2. Technologies Used

  For this project, we are using Visual Studio code & Visual Studio Community for our IDEs.
  
  For the sharing of program and the overall stocking of the entire project, we are using Github and the software Github Desktop.
  
  When it comes to the notes played, we are using the library SFML that allows us to play notes directly from our computers.
