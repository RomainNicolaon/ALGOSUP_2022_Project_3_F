# First Step
  ### Week 1
  At first, Eloi explained some basics of theoretical music, then we split into four groups based on the steps needed for the first step (here we will only talk about what was used in the technical way of the project):
  
  First step (Eloi/Elise)
    The first step is to create an oscilator function that enables us to create waveforms as their four basic forms, Square, Sine, Triangle, Sawtooth
    
    ***code for each calculus***
    
  Second Step (Thomas)
    A function to save waveform to disk, so it can be played back through a standard audio application
    
      ***important code to point at***
  Third Step (Robin)
  A function to read a section of an audio file from disk
  
    ***important code to point at***
    
  Fourth Step (Romain/Th√©o)
  A function to play the waveform directly without saving it to disk
  
    ***important code to point at***
