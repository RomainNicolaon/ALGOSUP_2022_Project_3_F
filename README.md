On this README, we will write every step of our project until the end and update it every time something has changed or when a task has ended or not

# 1. First Part

  At first, Eloi explained some basics of theoretical music, then we split into four groups based on the steps needed for the first step:
  
## 1.1. First Step
    
   The first step is to create an oscilator function that enables us to create waveforms as their four basic forms, Square, Sine, Triangle, Sawtooth
    
   - [x] Square Wave
   - [x] Sinus Wave
   - [x] Triangle Wave
   - [x] Sawtooth Wave

   ***code for each calculus***

## 1.2. Second Step
  A function to save waveform to disk, so it can be played back through a standard audio application
  
  - [x] Step 1

  ***important code to point at***
  
## 1.3. Third Step
  A function to read a section of an audio file from disk
  
  - [x] Step 1
  
  ***important code to point at***

## 1.4. Fourth Step

  A function to play the waveform directly without saving it to disk

  - [ ] Step 1

   ***important code to point at***
